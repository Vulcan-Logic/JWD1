                <p>
                    My name is Vineet W. Singh aka Vinnie. 
                    My cultural heritage is Indian/Punjabi and I was born and bred
                    in Chandigarh, India.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I studied in St. John's High School which is currently ranked
                    as the No. 1 Boys' private school in India.
                    I read mathematics and gained a B.Sc. in mathematics from
                    The University of London.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started working in my family business after finishing school
                    and I worked in the manufacturing industry where I was exposed
                    to the use of various technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I moved to Sydney in 2018 and I worked in a manufacturing business
                    in St. Mary's as a Purchase Officer for a year.
